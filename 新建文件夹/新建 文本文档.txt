I think targeted advertising is an invasion of privacy. Online advertising that uses personal information to target specific groups of people can also be a misuse of personal data. Personal data may be used for other purposes, such as tracking a user's behavior, preferences and habits to create a detailed portrait of the user, which can lead to abuse and potential personal injury. In addition, some criminals will use these personal data to carry out criminal acts. This has caused great harm to consumers.
